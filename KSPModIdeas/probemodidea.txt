Hibernation mode for probes (no power used)
Need to scan planets for a 'HiRes' image of planets surface
if the probe loses power the will be an icon on the map view of where last contact was
there will be a blurry some what accurate the show the probes trajectory

need to seed scinece prbe to gain gravity,size,atmo,rotation,etc,etc
 
(Static)solar panels on planets will gain dust and lose dust on the surface of the panels at random this will change the efficiently of the solar panels

-Hibernation mode for probes, Minimal power used, no control
-Solar panels on planets with an atmosphere, will randomly gain and lose "Dust" which will effect the efficency of the panels
-If a probe loses power, its orbital trajectory will disappear with only a somwhat accurate path of the probe last recorded trajectory
---Science-----
-to get a full resolution map of the planet you will need to send probe to image the surface
-to get full stats(Gravity,Size,Atmo height,Etc,etc) send probe to record the data
