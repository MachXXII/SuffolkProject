Right, then.

Time has refined my views.

*cracks knuckles*

- Low-density belt of vulcanoid asteroids below the orbit of Moho

- Eve:

- Inclination reduced to make an easier early-game interplanetary target

- Hotter and generally more angry atmosphere on Eve

- Eve not violently purple (I regret this to this day)

- Perpetual clouds and heavy haze, thunder ambiance, flashes of lightning and a surface dark enough to require lights to see properly (except when the lightning is going of course)

- Kerbin:

- Small amounts of eccentricity and inclination

- Mun:

- More realistic crater distribution in both size and location (very uniform, as it stands)

- Tycho crater ripoff with properly shaped solid-black monolith

- Duna:

- More, flatter lowlands, more obvious ancient water-carved features

- More irregular ice caps with super cool features

- An additional asteroidal moon, far beyond Ike, if the systems allowed it it would have irregular rotation like Pluto's small moons are expected to (due to the odd dynamics of a binary planet system)

- Ike:

- Return of the magic boulder

- Craters and a more moon-like heightmap

- Asteroids discoverable in the actual asteroid belt, along with a significant quantify of larger asteroids

- Jool:

- Re-arrangement of major moons to be more widely spaced and similar to Saturn's layout of moons

- 150% its original size, with enlarged moon orbits as well

- Not so green (as with Eve, I still regret such an intense color), perhaps green bands instead, which when sampled yield algae...

- Oblateness similar to that of Saturn's or Jupiter's (requires reworking of how atmospheres are handled)

- Uncomfortable quantities of minor moons

- Laythe:

- Smaller, Duna sized

- Mostly cloud covered

- Scattered with active volcanoes

- No ice caps (hot greenhouse atmosphere would destroy them easily)

- Faint torus of gas along its orbit from escaping atmosphere (not enough to affect ships, but enough to catch the light, see Saturn's E ring [although you could of course get crazy with it and make it enough to change your orbit using aerodynamic surfaces... paging Larry Niven])

- Vall:

- Smaller, Mun sized

- Scratchy surface like that of Europa/Eeloo

- Tylo:

- Smaller, slightly below Duna sized

- Two-thirds-gee surface gravity (High for a body of that size, so perhaps a dense iron core surrounded by ices; a body from the inner solar system that was ejected and then captured by Jool)

- Ice geysers + resulting atmosphere

- Second faint gas torus

- New Planet: Mez

- Super-Kerbin with rapid rotation period, somewhat lens-shaped as a result (as later calculations of the properties of good old planet Mesklin suggested)

- Thick atmosphere

- Gravity at poles approaches 10-20g, gravity at equator only ~0.05g

- Scale height of atmosphere varies accordingly, and grows very diffuse and stretched around the equator

- ... which is annoyingly impossible with current systems unless the atmosphere can be rejiggered to work with non-spherical bodies (Dear ferram...)

- Eeloo:

- Surface like our new best friend Pluto with neat flowy stuff and everything

- Small blob of a moon

- Extra bodies with analogues of most real-world dwarf planets (especially Sedna)

Technical advances required:

- Functional atmospheres for non-spherical bodies

- Proper altitude detection for non-spherical bodies

- Non-spherical atmosphere rendering

- Gas torus rendering

- Dynamic loading/unloading of planet surface maps to keep memory usage sane (or just 64-bit and deal with the inefficiency)

- Ambient sound system for planets

- Irregular planetary rotation (optional, for Duna's minimoon)

- Clouds

I would make all of the system covered with a fog of scientific undiscovery which could only be removed partially with telescopes and more accurately with probes.

Oh yes, I forgot this in my post. That's an absolute essential. Players should be blown away when finding out Laythe has oceans after finally probing beneath it's clouds, for instance.
